## Coverity Patch Overview

This repository includes a patch file located at `.github/patches/coverity`, which is specifically designed to improve the effectiveness of Coverity static analysis scans.

### Purpose

The patch reflects necessary modifications to Coverity configuration files to increase the number of **Captured Compilation Units (CCUs)** to at least **85%**, which is the minimum threshold required by [scan.coverity.com](https://scan.coverity.com) to perform a successful analysis.

### Background

Coverity Build Tool currently lacks full support for the latest versions of **Intel DPCPP compiler**, which is commonly used in modern C++ projects, especially those involving SYCL or heterogeneous computing. As a result, many compilation units are not captured during the default build process, leading to failure to meet Coverity scanning requirements and server side analysis rejection.

### Solution

The patch introduces configuration changes and workarounds that help Coverity recognize and process a greater portion of the build, despite the limitations with DPCPP. These changes may include:

- Adjustments to compiler flags
- Substitutions or wrappers for unsupported compiler calls
- Environment variable tweaks
- Additional build script logic

By applying this patch, the project can meet the CCU threshold and ensure that Coverity performs a meaningful and complete static analysis.

### Support

The patch is expected (not required) to be reviewed after each Coverity Build Tool version upgrade (~once an year) for relevance of the changes it contains, some of which may become obsolete due to improved Intel compiler support in future versions of the Coverity Build Tool.

### Patch update acceptance criteria

Any update in patch must meet the basic criterion - the total percentage of captured compilation units must be equal or greater than 85%. Otherwise, the analysis will not start because of server-side limitation.
